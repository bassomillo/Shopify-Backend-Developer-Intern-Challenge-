# Shopify-Backend-Developer-Intern-Challenge-

The backend of the project uses the ASP.net Core MVC framework to manage the web API services and MongoDB ATLAS to control the database.

The replit is being used for deployment. 

For the basic CRUD part, the project has the APIs which can let users search the whole list of inventories and search the specific inventory by product id. 

And users can also update the inventory and create new inventory into the database. 

For the advanced function, this project can let users to delete with comments and can undelete the inventory. 

The way to achieve this is to use the recycle bin. 

When the user deletes an inventory, it will be put into the recycle bin collection and if the user wants the inventory undeletion, it can be moved from the recycle bin back to the inventory collection.
